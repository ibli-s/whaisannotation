Traffic Annotation Practice â€“ Indian Urban Dataset

A small image annotation project using [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/) to label objects commonly found in Indian road traffic scenes.  
Built to practice object recognition labeling formats for real-world CV projects.

Why I Built This

I wanted to understand how visual datasets are prepared for training object detection models. This practice set helped me learn:
- How to use annotation tools
- How to label multiple object types consistently
- How to export in YOLO format

 ðŸ›  How to Try It Yourself

1. Go to [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/)
2. Upload your own traffic images (or use sample images)
3. Use bounding boxes / polygon to label objects such as:
   - Car
   - Bike
   - Traffic Light
   - Pedestrian
4. Export the annotations in YOLO/format


ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Makesense.ai (Online annotation tool)
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) annotation format
- Indian traffic scene images (sample set)
