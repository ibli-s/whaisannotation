trying out annotation for internship
Annotation Practice Set
 Project Overview
This project involves annotating street images by labeling vehicles, pedestrians, signboards, traffic lights, and lane markings using Makesense.ai. The labeled dataset is aimed to support training of YOLO models to improve object detection in edge-case traffic scenarios.

Tools Used
- Makesense.ai for image annotation (no install needed)
- YOLO annotation format for compatibility with popular object detection models

 What I did
- Collected 5 diverse street images showing various road elements.
- Annotated each image carefully to labels.
- Exported labels in YOLO format for machine learning applications.

 Skills Demonstrated
- Visual data annotation and dataset creation
- Understanding of object detection pipeline preparation
- Attention to detail in labeling edge-case scenarios
